#Chat with PDF using Gemini

This Streamlit application allows users to interact with PDF documents using conversational AI powered by Gemini and Google's generative AI.


##Features:

 -**Upload PDF files**: Users can upload multiple PDF documents.
 -**Processes PDFs**:   Extracts text from uploaded PDFs and creates text chunks for indexing.
 -**Search and Chat**:  Users can ask questions related to the PDF content and receive answers using a combination of FAISS vector search and generative AI.


 ##Requirements:

 - Python 3.7+
 - Libraries specified in 'requirements.txt'.
 - Google API Key configured via environment variable 'GOOGLE_API_KEY'.


 ##Installation and Setup:

 1. **Clone the repository**:

      ''' bash
      git clone <repository_url>
      cd <repository_name>
      '''

 2. **Install dependencies**:

      '''bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      '''

 3. **Set up environment variables**:

      Create a '.env' file in the root directory and add your Google API Key:
      '''makefile
      GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
      '''


#Usage:

 1. **Run the application**:

      '''bash
      streamlit run main.py
      '''

 2. **Interact with the application**:

      - Upload PDF files via file uploader.
      - Wait for "Processing PDFs..."
      - Enter a question related to the PDF(s) content in the text input field "💬 Ask a question about your PDF(s):".
      - Click "🔍 Get Answer" to get an answer generated by the Gemini 2.5 Flash/Pro model.

## About:

This project demonstrates the integration of PDF processing, semantic search using FAISS, and conversational AI with Google's generative models
through the Gemini API. It's designed to provide an intuitive interface for querying and retrieving information from uploaded PDF documents.

##Credits:

- **Streamlit**: Fronted framework for building interactive web applications.
- **PyPDF2**: Library for reading and manipulating PDF files in Python.
- **langchain**: Python library for natural language processing tasks.
- **FAISS**: Vector database for semantic search on PDF chunks
- **Gemini 2.5 API**: Generative AI for answering questions using retrieved PDF context
- **Google Generative AI**: API used for generating AI responses based on context and questions.
